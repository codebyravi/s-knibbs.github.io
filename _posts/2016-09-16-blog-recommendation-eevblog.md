The [EEVblog](http://www.eevblog.com/) is an electronics video blog hosted on YouTube by David L. Jones, an enthusiastic electronics design engineer from Sydney, Australia.

His videos are a mixture of product teardowns, reviews, [tutorials & educational content](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvOlSehNtuHtWlH0UOZNtOn-FlFCn1GYw).
He also debunks some of the more dubious Kickstarter / Indiegogo projects such as [solar roadways](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obS6TUVSZds&list=PLvOlSehNtuHvPZ1-dDC449w_r2M0R4jtc) and the
[batteriser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iEshd6izgk&list=PLvOlSehNtuHvBpmbLABRmSKv2b0C4LWV_). In total there are over 350 videos now with new videos uploaded every couple of days.

I would highly recommend this to anyone studying electronics at university or for anyone with a hobbyist interest in electronics. I would have found this useful when I studied
electronics at university, had it existed back then. I found the "world's worst tablet" teardown particularly entertaining:
